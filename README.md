# Roadmap

Public roadmap for Shalom chat

## What is Shalom?

Shalom is a realtime chat platform in development. It is not (currently) open-source, but we encourage participation via feature requests and bug reports.

## This repository

Take a look at the issues to vote on new features, or open an issue to suggest a feature to be included or report a bug.
